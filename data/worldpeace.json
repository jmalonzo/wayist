Its bones are soft and it muscles are weak yet its grip is secure.", "55.2": "It is not aware of male and female yet its genitals are aroused.", "55.3": "Its oneness is perfect. It screams all day without becoming hoarse. This is the perfection of harmony.", "55.4": "Knowing harmony is acknowledging the oneness of Infinity.

Indifference is the product of maintaining one's focus on the oneness of all things. If you are at one with Infinity and the potential of all things, then you have no limitations.
