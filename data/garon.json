The truly wise love themselves but do not take pride in themselves. They reject the one and accept the other.", "73.0": " One of courage, with audacity, will kill. One of courage, but gentle, spares life. From these two kinds of courage arise harm and benefit. Even if Tao dislikes certain people, who can say why? The truly wise regard this as a most difficult question. Tao does not contend but it surely wins, does not speak but it surely responds, does not command but things come of themselves. It is empty yet contains the master plan. The net of Tao is all-encompassing, its meshes are wide, yet nothing is lost.", "74.0": " If the people do not fear death, why threaten them with it? If the people do fear death, and if the unlawful be killed, who would dare to execute them? Only the Supreme Executioner kills. To take His place is to set an unskilled man to wield the hatchet of the master carpenter: he rarely escapes chopping off his own hand!", "75.0": " The people starve when rulers impose heavy taxes. That is why people starve. The people are rebellious when rulers meddle in their affairs. That is why people are rebellious. The people do not fear death when they try to lead a better life. That is why they do not fear death. Those who do not interfere with life receive genuine value from it.", "76.0": " Living, man is supple and yielding;  when dead, man is hard and stiff. Living, animals and plants are soft and pliant;  when dead, they are withered and brittle. Being inflexible and unyielding is part of dying;  being flexible and yielding is part of living. A headstrong legion will lose in war just as an unyielding tree will snap under the axe. The place of the strong is below;  the place of the gentle is above.", "77.0": " Is not Tao like the drawn bow? The highest part is lowered, the lowest part is raised. Overall length is shortened, overall depth is lengthened. So the Great Tao lowers the highest and raises the lowest. But the Tao of man increases the high and decreases the low. Who can take from the high and give to the low? Only the true follower of Tao. Thus, the truly wise act but are not possessive, achieve but claim no credit, because they have no desire for vain glory.", "78.0": " Nothing in the world is weaker or more yielding than water. Yet nothing is its equal in wearing away the hard and strong. There is nothing quite like it. Thus the weak can overpower the strong;  the flexible can overcome the rigid. The whole world can perceive this, but does not put it into practice. And so the truly wise say: Whoever bears the shame of the nation is fit to lead the nation. Whoever bears the sins of the world is fit to lead the world. Straight words (truth) can seem crooked (paradoxical).", "79.0": " Settling a great dispute leaves some hatred behind. Can this be good? Therefore the truly wise defend the weak and do not seek vengeance. The man with Teh fosters reconciliation;  the man without Teh fosters reaction. And so it is truly said: While Tao is impartial, it permeates good men.", "80.0": " The ideal state is small with few people. It has abundance of goods, beyond possible use. Understanding death, the people do not emigrate. Though they have vessels and vehicles, they do not travel far in them. Though they have armour and weapons, they have no need to display them. Let them use knotted ropes for simple reckoning, be satisfied with their food, be attractive in their clothing, be comfortable in their homes, be happy with their customs. Though from other states the dog's bark and cock's crow can clearly be heard, the people never leave the ideal state.", "81.0": " Words of truth are not high-sounding;  high-sounding words are not the truth. One who has Teh does not argue;  one who argues does not have Teh. The truly wise do not know many things; one who knows many things is not truly wise. The truly wise do not selfishly crave. They live for other people and thereby grow richer. They give freely of themselves and thereby have great abundance. The great Tao endows, but does so unconditionally. The Tao of the wise accomplishes, but does so unselfishly."}]
