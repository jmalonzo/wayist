# Wayist

This is a mirror (sans UI) of the [Tao Te Ching Compared](http://www.wayist.org/ttc%20compared/index.htm) site from [Wayist](http://www.wayist.org).

This project aims to provide a nicer desktop and mobile UI for the Tao Te Ching content from Wayist. All content are from the Wayist site and copyright by the respective translators.
