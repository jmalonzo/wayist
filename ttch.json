To conduct one's life according to the Tao, is to conduct one's life without regrets; to realize that potential within oneself which is of benefit to all. Though words or names are not required to live one's life this way, to describe it, words and names are used, that we might better clarify the way of which wespeak, without confusing it with other ways in which an individual might choose to live. Through knowledge, intellectual thought and words, the manifestations of the Tao are known, but without such intellectual intent we might experience the Taoitself.

By using the means appropriate, we extend ourselves beyond the barriers of such complexity, and so experience the Tao.

That which a person knows he has is known to him by that which he does not have, and that which he considers difficult seems so because of that which he cando with ease. One thing seems long by comparison with that which is, comparatively, short. One thing is high because another thing is low; only when sound ceases isquietness known, and that which leads is seen to lead only by being followed. In comparison, the sage, in harmony with the Tao, needs no comparisons, and when he makes them, knows that comparisons are judgments, and just as relativeto he who makes them, and to the situation, as they are to that on which the judgment has been made. Through his experience, the sage becomes aware that all things change, and that he who seems to lead, might also, in another situation, follow. So he does nothing; he neither leads nor follows. That which he does is neither big nor small; without intent, it is neither difficult, nor done with ease. His task completed, he then lets go of it; seeking no credit, he cannot be discredited.

The person who possesses many things, but does not boast of his possessions, reduces temptation, and reduces stealing.

Satisfied with his possessions, the sage eliminates the need to steal; at one with the Tao, he remains free of envy, and has no need of titles. By being supple, he retains his energy. He minimizes his desires, and does not train himself in guile, nor subtle words of praise. By not contriving, he retains the harmony of his inner world, and so remains at peace within himself. It is for reasons such as these, that an administration which is concerned with the welfare of those it serves, does not encourage status and titles to be sought, norencourage rivalry.

When untangled by a cutting edge, the cord in little pieces lies, and is of little use.

With patience, tangled cord may be undone, and problems which seem insoluble, resolved.

In speech, sincerity guides the man of Tao, and as a leader, he is just. In management, competence is his aim, and he ensures the pacing is correct.

Having no desires, he was untouched by craving. Receptive and mysterious, his knowledge was unfathomable, causing others to think him hesitant.

Being one with the Tao is to be at peace, and to be in conflict with it, leads to chaos and dysfunction. When the consistency of the Tao is known, the mind is receptive to its states of change.

It seldom speaks, and never asks, but is answered without a question. It is supplied with all its needs and is constantly at ease because it follows its own plan which cannot be understood by man. It casts its net both deep and wide, and 'though coarse meshed, it misses nothing in the tide. ", "74.0": "If the people are not afraid of death, they have no fear of threats of death.

The way of the ordinary person, is not the way of the Tao, for such people take from those who are poor and give to those who are rich.

The food they eat is plain and good, and their clothes are simple; their homes are secure, without the need of bolts and bars, and they are happy in their ways.

Those who have knowledge of the natural way do not train themselves in cunning, whilst those who use cunning to rule their lives, and the lives of others, are notknowledgeable of the Tao, nor of natural happiness. The sage seeks not to have a store of things or knowledge, for he knows, the less of these he has, the more he has, and that the more he gives, the greater hisabundance.
