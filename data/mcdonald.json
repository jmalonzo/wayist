He reaches his [most cherished] ends. He is far from high-handed, he can be bright, but refrains from dazzling.", "59.1": "In managing human affairs, there's no better rule than to be sparing, which is to forestall. You can't rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store; Be [simply artistic] frugal, there's nothing better for serving heaven and ruling people.", "59.2": "To forestall is to be prepared and strengthened; and by being frugal in such ways one may recover quickly. To recover quickly means to accumulate [intense moral] rather much. This \"laying up a store\" means quickly absorbing, And \"quickly absorbing\" in the end means doubling one's garnered \"power\". Double your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome. By the heavy accumulation of virtue one can overcome everything. Be prepared and strengthened to be always victorious: to have infinite capacity; If there's nothing it can't overcome, it knows no bounds, then he will acquire a capacity with limits well beyond anyone's knowledge. One can next overcome nearly everything. And only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp.", "59.3": " If his capacity is beyond anyone's knowledge, he is fit to rule a kingdom. Who has infinite capacity is fit to rule, but only he who having the kingdom goes to the mother, can keep it long. He who possesses he mother (dao) of the state will last long. The mother (principle) of a ruling country can long endure.", "59.4": "This is called the art of making the roots strike deep by fencing the trunk, It signifies to be firmly rooted, to have deep strength, for the roots are deep and the stalks are firm, road to immortality and enduring vision, the way of long life and everlasting existence is won by making life long by fixed staring.", "60.1": "Ruling a big kingdom is like frying a small fish.", "60.2": "They who by dao ruled all that's under heaven did not let an evil spirit within them display its powers.", "60.3": "Such evil spirits did not display their supernatural powers; the spirits of wise men were hardly used to hurt other men. So when dao is employed to rule the kingdom, spiritual beings will lose their supernatural grip and cease to harm common people. And their supernatural power will far from harm people, and the wise man also will refrain from harming people.", "60.4": "When both don't do each other harm, virtue (power) flows towards them. If the sage's good spirit is nowhere mobilised to harm other men, he himself can be saved from [deterioration] harm. And so, if evil spirits and supermen don't harm each other, each can be quite saved from harm. Furthermore, some of their \"tall abilities\" could converge. If so, virtue can be accumulated in both for ulterior benefit or towards some common [soap opera] end.", "61.1": "A big kingdom can be compared to the lower part of a river, like the low ground which all streams flow down towards. Here is a point towards which all things under heaven converge. Its part must be that of the woman who overcomes man by simple quietude. By [such as] quiescence she gets underneath, and by tranquillity she is down under.", "61.2": "A big kingdom can take over [a soul of] a small one if it succeeds in getting itself below the small kingdom; If so it absorbs some from the small country, or wins some adherence of the small kingdom in the open.", "61.3": "If a small country on the other hand places itself below a big country, it can absorbs or take over some of the big country [assets]. Therefore some place themselves low so as to take over or absorb (others). Some are (naturally) low and absorb (others). Because small kingdoms are by nature in this way underneath large kingdoms, they [sometimes] win the adherence of large kingdoms [or end].", "61.4": "What a big kingdom is after is but to annex and herd others. So what large countries really need is a lot of inhabitants. What small countries need is some place where their surplus inhabitants can go and get employment. What they want can be little more that to join, be somewhat sheltered and perhaps serve for it all.", "61.5": "Both can have what they want; I say the large kingdom must \"get underneath\".", "62.1": "Dao is thought up as the mysterious secret of the universe, it could be the storehouse of \"all things\", like the pivotal worship centre in the south-west corner in the [old Chinese] house. It's the good man's treasure and the bad man's support and resort.", "62.2": "Fine words can buy honour, fine sayings can be sold. Fine deeds can win respect from others. The best conduct is a gift. Persons of noble, grave demeanour are accepted as gifts. Even if a man is bad, when has (dao) rejected him? Why reject bad people [the winners of tomorrow if all goes fine]? Even the bad let slip no opportunity to acquire gifts that fit them well enough.", "62.3": "Therefore on the crowning of an emperor and appointing his three ministers of the state, rather than send ta disc of jade and teams of four horses, sit down and deliver this dao. It can be done without moving from one's seat.", "62.4": "What did the old ones say of this dao, how did they prize it? Why did they treasure such dao? Did they not say of those that have it \"Pursuing, they shall catch; pursued, they shall escape?\" Or, \"Search for the guilty ones and pardon them?\" Or, \"Those who seek shall have it, those who sin shall be freed\"? They thought [common] dao to be the most precious, the treasure of the world.", "63.1": "Succeed in the magician's wu-wei: Accomplish seemingly do-nothing. Attend seemingly to no-affairs. And do completely without ado. What runs, acts without action, does without doing, So let's taste without tasting. Taste the flavourless. Taste the flavourless without tasting. Find flavourless flavour.", "63.2": "Whether it's big or small, many or few, requite hatred with virtue. Dao can make the small great and the few many, can requite injuries with some decent deeds.", "63.3": "But prepare for the hard while it's still easy. Deal with it while it's still easy. Deal with the great or big while it's still small. In governing your kingdom everything hard must be dealt with while it's still easy.", "63.4": "The hard has to be dealt with while still very easy. All the great (ones and great problems) of the world are to be dealt with while they're yet small. Everything great must be dealt with while it's still small.", "63.5": "Therefore the wise man never has to deal with the great; and so gets greatness. He never strives for the great, by this the great is had. So great undertakings shall start with what's small.", "63.6": "But again \"Who makes rash promises surely lacks. Who lightly makes a promise, can find it too hard to keep his faith. And light assent inspires little confidence. Who takes things very easily is surely in for dealing with more difficulty in the end. So \"many easies\" means many a hard. In other words, who makes light of many things should find many difficulties.", "64.1": "What remains placid is quite easy to hold. Not determined happenings can be prepared for well in advance. Before there has been an omen it's easy to lay plans. It's easy to forestall some things that don't are or not yet occur. It's quite easy to plan for and prepare well in advance. [But such forestalling is had by thoughts, and thoughts are airy and can be tender and brittle, to say the least.] And what's brittle is easy to crack. What's tender is easily torn. What's brittle like ice is easy to melt. And what's tiny is easy to scatter.", "64.2": "[All the same, reach up to] deal with things in their state of not-yet-being; deal with things well before they appear. Just put things well in shape before disorder and confusion. Put all very well in order before disorder, and next go on to check loss or disorder well.", "64.3": "A tree as big as a man's hug grows from a tiny sprout. A tower nine storeys high begins with a clod of earth. Further, the journey of three hundred miles began with ... the feet. A journey of a thousand li begins right where one stands, even with the very first step.", "64.4": "Still, he who takes a [visible forestalling] action fails. Who acts, harms; he who grabs, lets slip. And therefore the wise man doesn't act in the open, and so doesn't spoil or harm; yes, he takes seemingly no action and therefore hardly fails. And why is this? It's due to: He who grasps things [often] loses them. He doesn't grasp a lot, he doesn't let slip a lot. Does hardly grab in the open, and so doesn't let slip a lot. He grasps nothing visibly to others, and therefore he doesn't lose much. Whereas people in their handling of affairs often fail when they're about to succeed at their tasks. Such people constantly spoil things when within an ace of completing them. Be as careful at the end as at the start to avert failures at hand. Then there will be no such failures. Heed the end no less than the start, so that your valuable work will not be spoiled and ruined.", "64.5": "Therefore the wise man learns to seem unlearned, wants only things that are unwanted. Yes, the wise man publicly desires to have no desire.", "64.6": "Therefore the wise man desires no desire - and desires all the same. He doesn't often value rare treasures publicly. He hardly values objects hard to get or find - in public. He says he learns that which is unlearned. He claims he sets no store by products difficult to get, and so teaches things untaught. [It's a trap.] But he also turns all beings back to the very thing they have left behind, so that he can assist in the course of nature somehow. And if so, \"the ten thousand creatures\" can be restored to their self-sameness, the self-so which is of [some] dao. Yes, he supports all things in some of their natural states. This he does; but hardly presume to interfere all right. He hardly dares to act in the open. So he denies to take any visible action.", "64.7": "From all this even the wise man regards things as hard, but he also knows how to make the easy difficult. For that reason he very seldom meets with difficulties. [Uha.]", "65.1": "In old times those who practised a dao well, did hardly aim to enlighten people, but to make them ignorant and hold them that way. ", "65.2": "It seems that the more knowledge people have, the harder they are to rule. Maybe it's hard for people to live in peace due to very much knowledge. So he who rules the state through knowledge is robber of the state; and who seek to rule by giving knowledge could be like [coming] bandits preying on the land. Maybe all who seek to rule by knowledge form the nation's curse, eventually. He who rules a state not through knowledge is a blessing. Those who seek not to rule by knowledge, are the nation's blessing. To rule without giving knowledge could bring a stock of good fortune to the land. [And maybe not.]", "65.3": "One who knows these two things also (sets) the standard. Always to know such an old standard is called to of the deep, secret calibre.", "65.4": "When such secret virtue becomes clear, outgoing, far-reaching, and lets things revert back to some guessed at source, all related things could return to some natural state. It could go all the way back to [brutal] concord and harmony.", "66.1": "How did the great rivers and seas become the kings of the ravines? By being experts at keeping low.", "66.2": "Therefore to be above the people you have to speak as though you're lower than the people in some ways. So to be ahead of the people, you have to follow them in your own person. To be foremost or guide well, walk behind.", "66.3": "The wise man keeps himself on top, and the people hardly feels his weight or get crushed by it in time. He guides in this way, and the people don't harm him the least. He can even walk in front [as an example], and people don't wish him harm. [Let's hope that.] In this dynamic [guru] way everything under heaven will be glad to be pushed by him and will not find his guidance irksome. Then the people of the world are glad, the world rejoices and praises him without getting tired of it, in order to uphold him forever.", "66.4": "He accomplishes his aims by overt non-striving. Because he doesn't compete in the open, no one can compete well with him.", "67.1": "Every one says my dao is greatly like folly. Just because it's great, it looks like folly. Great ways don't look like the ordinary anyhow. If it did not look like folly, it could have turned small and petty long ago! Then it would have been small. As for things that don't look foolish to common men, there can be no question about their smallness.", "67.2": "I have three treasures. Guard and keep them: The first is a deep, deep concern; call it mystic pity, if you like. The second is never too much, which may mean frugality. And the third is refusal to be ahead, foremost or first, for I hardly dare to be ahead.", "67.3": "Deep, concerned love brings guts [or fall]. Through not doing too much, one has amplitude (of reserve power): Who has spared, may then give and seem generous. Through not presuming to be the first and best there is, one can develop one's talent and strength; let it mature to dominate a world.", "67.4": "On the other hand, to be bold by forsaking deep love; to be generous by forsaking frugality-won reserves and clever, artful restraint; and to be ahead and rushing in front by forsaking following behind; all this could prove fatal in the end.", "67.5": "Ardent, loving concern can't fight well without conquering a lot. It shall help in the case of attack, and likewise to be firm in the case of defence. When heaven is to save a person, heaven will protect him through deep love. Heaven arms those it would not see beaten, with all right concern. [Let's hope that.]", "68.1": "A skilful leader of troops is never oppressive with his military strength. The brave soldier is hardly very violent; The best fighter doesn't become visibly angry; he hardly loses his temper.", "68.2": "A skilful conqueror doesn't compete with people. The great conqueror doesn't fight for small issues alone. The best user of men acts as though he were their inferior and puts himself below them by the virtue of not-competing.", "68.3": "This is called the ability or capacity to use men, or matching heaven, or being suited to the highest found principle, [maybe of old]", "69.1": "The strategists say: \"If I dare not be the guest, then let me be the host. When I dare not take the offensive, then I'll take the defensive. If you doubt your ability to advance, then retreat.\" Also: \"When you doubt your ability to meet the enemy's attack, take the offensive yourself.\"", "69.2": "Much of this his implies to march without visible formations; its in part like rolling up the sleeve, and yet presenting no bare arm. Or it could be like stretching your arm without showing the sleeves. Confront well, present no battle-front yourself. Refrain from charging in frontal attacks, and seem to be armed without weapons. [Let that come as a surprise.] Hold a thousand weapons without seeming to have them.", "69.3": "Now, great calamity comes from making light of an enemy. There's no greater catastrophe than if a foolishly underestimated enemy robs and destroys your most cherished treasures. It could even destroy your topmost treasure, your old, dear body. Refrain from having an enemy at the price of losing your body and life. Remember: He whose enemy presents no front, could lose his booty.", "69.4": "Therefore when armies meet, the kind-looking man of sorrows could win [by such as surprise tactics. But often it's the opposite that happens.] Who doesn't delight in warfare in the open, he wins. [And most often not?]", "70.1": "My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice. Yet no one understands them; no one puts them into practice.", "70.2": "But some of my teaching could have nature as a source, and also there's a principle-ruled ancestry in some of my words. Yes, [some of] my deeds have a lord; my deeds could have [right] dao as sovereign. Most men don't understand this, they're unable to understand me. Few people understand me, and on this my real value depends. I am highly valued, for few understand me.", "70.3": "The wise man wears a coarse cloth on top and carries jade underneath his dress, within his bosom.", "71.1": "To know that you do not know is best. Who knows that he doesn't know is the highest. To know when one doesn't know is best. Who pretends to know what he doesn't know is sick-minded; To think one knows when one doesn't know is a sort of malady. Pretend to know when you don't know - that's a disease. He who recognises this disease as a disease can also cure himself of it [and maybe not]. [One may eventually get free from a disease by recognising it for what it is.] Who recognises sick-mindedness as sick-mindedness can't be wholly sick-minded, after all.", "71.2": "The wise man is hardly sick-minded if he recognises sick mind as sick and also cures some diseases. He's hardly a sick mind.", "72.1": "If the people hardly fear what's dreadful, something greatly dreadful could descend. If people have no fear of force, then great force descends. So never mind if people are not intimidated by your authority. Some mightier authority could deal with them in the long run.", "72.2": "Neither despise their dwellings nor narrow the living space of their dwellings. They could cease to turn away if you don't put them in jail. Don't dislike their offspring, harass or oppress their lives. Don't harass them, and they could cease to turn from you. Drop heavy taxes, and the people won't be fed up. If you don't persecute all, you'll hardly be so much disliked. They're not oppressed if you refrain from gross oppressive measures.", "72.3": "So the wise man knows himself but hardly shows off. Knows his own value, but doesn't exalt himself. Truly, \"he rejects the one (brute force or enemicy) but accepts or takes the other (being some kind, sturdy neighbour).\"", "73.1": "Who is brave in daring can kill or get killed [on a bus]. On the other hand, one who is brave in not daring, can survive or give life. ", "73.2": "Either approach can be profitable or unprofitable, still one of them is harmful. Who is brave in non-daring without ado lets live. There can be some advantage and some disadvantage in each approach - Now, \"Dao-heaven hates the one it hates, hates what it hates; and none can know the reason why.\" Who knows why and what it dislikes? Heaven dislikes certain people; but the wise man considers it a tricky question. Yes, why heaven seems to hate - even a wise man regards it as a tricky question.", "73.3": "Well, it's in the fixed dao sets of heaven not to strive in the open, but none the less to conquer. Not to compete, but all the same win expertly. Be good at conquest without strife. Dao hardly speaks, it skilfully responds. It comes without skilful invitation, it can appear without a call. It doesn't seem anxious about things and yet it shows up it plans very well. It gets able results without obvious design, as from hidden, laid, [broad] plans and schemes. [Say little, foster well laid schemes and designs.]", "73.4": "Dao-heaven's net is wide, with big, coarse meshes. Still it misses nothing. Nothing slips through.", "74.1": "When the people are not afraid of death, why threaten them with death sentences?", "74.2": "Even supposing the people are constantly afraid of death and we can seize and kill those who are unruly or vicious, who would dare to slay them?", "74.3": "There's always the master executioner (Heaven). To kill in his stead is like thrusting oneself into he master-carpenter's place and doing his chipping for him. \"He who tries it is lucky if he doesn't cut his hand,\" they say. To undertake executions for the master executioner is like hewing wood for him. It rarely happens you escape injuring your own hands. Now, often it happens as well that the executioner is killed - And to take the place of the executioner is in part like handling the hatchet for the master carpenter. He who handles the hatchet for the master carpenter seldom escapes injury to his hands.", "75.1": "People are hungry because rulers eat too much income, too much tax-grain. Therefore they starve, but also because of bad interference from those above.", "75.2": "Some turn hard to rule as their rulers do too many things. That's why they're hard to keep in order.", "75.3": "If so, the people are not very afraid of death, as they're anxious to make a living. That's why they take death lightly in such cases. So: Those who interfere not with their living that are wise in exalting life. Maybe he who seeks only little after life can excel in making life valuable. But all that have hearts set only little on life could be superior to those who set store by life.", "76.1": "When man is born, he is tender and weak. In death he becomes stiff and hard.", "76.2": "All things, the grass as well as trees, are supple and soft while alive. When dead they become brittle and dried.", "76.3": "So hardness and stiffness very often accompany death, the soft and gentle could be companions of life.", "76.4": "The headstrong army will lose in battle. They say \"the weapon that's too hard will be broken, the tree that has the hardest wood will be cut down\". Yes, a hard tree will be cut down. So the hard and mighty eventually should be cast down; and the soft and weak may be set on high.", "77.1": "Heaven's way is like the bending of a bow. When a bow is bent the top comes down and the bottom-end comes up.", "77.2": "So too could heaven take away from those who have too much, and give to those that have not enough. Take away from those that have too much and give to those that have not enough. But this is far from man's way. He takes away from those that have not enough to offer those who already have too much.", "77.3": "The man of dao can fool enough and spare, and next give to the whole world.", "77.4": "So the wise man acts, but doesn't possess, accomplishes but lays claim to no credit. If he accomplishes a task, achieves an aim, he doesn't wish to reveal himself as better than others. So he seems to claim no credit. He seems to have no wish to appear superior, no desire to display excellence.", "78.1": "There's hardly anything more yielding than [gas, air, and] water, but almost none is better in attacking the resistant and hard, There are few substitutes for it.", "78.2": "Thus the yielding may conquer the resistant and the soft the hard. This was utilised by none I knew.", "78.3": "Wise sayings, \"Only he who has accepted the dirt of a country can be lord of its soil-shrines: can become heaven-accepted there.

And to patch up great hatred is sure to leave some hatred behind; how can this be regarded as satisfactory?", "79.2": "So the wise man keeps the obligation of a contract and refrains from blaming the other party. He stays where he is and does not go round making claims on people.", "79.3": "Therefore good people attend to their obligations, while those without virtue attend to other people's mistakes.", "79.4": "The way of heaven is impartial.
